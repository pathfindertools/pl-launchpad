Website MVP:

Have a website explaining what launchpad is:

-Overview of the program
-Include a timeline of the program and curriculum overview
-Overview PLN network and web3
-Current projects people in the network are working on

Target Audience:
-Mid level/senior software engineers coming from web2 who are looking to transition into web3
-Current builders in the web3 space
-Startup operators
-Technically anyone and everyone



Cadet Experience:

  -Previous projects cadets are working on
  -Where previous cadets have come from/user personas
  -What the program is not
  -Difference between matched vs unmatched cadets
Other:

-Website must be able to be modified easily since Launchpad will change as we iterate on it.
-Must be hosted on web3

Nice to haves:
-A section for current folks in the PLN network interested in launchpad and hiring managers
-Application integration through greenhouse(I am checking with Jeremy K on talent to make sure this is possible)
-Colo week page
-Add in melody sheep video

Stretch Goals
-Research section(specifically focused on funding the commons)
-Outer-core section
-Map of the PLN network and research with tech stacks
-Pre-reqs for the program/pre-work
-Alumni page

Design Mood
-Inviting
-Exciting but not infantilizing.
-Space themed

Existing research, products/projects, or other preliminary work (PL and external)

Stack Proposal:
-Microgen

-Fleek

Limitations on Stack:
-I have basic vanilla js experience and am still ramping up to web3/the PLN network so I both very open to trying new things/learning but still need this website to be easily changeable.
